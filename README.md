## Features and Screenshots

The main purpose of this application is to generate random and strong passwords. It lets an user choose:
1. Whether to include lowercase, uppercase, digit or punctuation individually or all of them.
2. Minimum number of each cases to be included in a password.
3. Whether to exclude some characters for each cases individually while generating a password.
4. By default, the generated password is hidden with `*` characters in the generated field to avoid shoulder-surfers. The user has the choice to view it using `Show/Hide` button.
5. Show password strength and comments on generated password to help users create strong passwords.

**N.B.: This application does not save the generated password. So make sure you save it somewhere safe like using Firefox Lockwise.**

First install the CLI Backend. Then install the GUI Frontend as
```
sudo dpkg -i python3-simple-pwgen*.deb
sudo dpkg -i simple-pwgen*.deb
```

### 2. Build and Install From Source
If you are having trouble installing the pre-built binary , build them from source.
#### Debian/Ubuntu based systems
There are two methods, this app can be installed/used on a Debian/Ubuntu based system. First, download and unzip the source package using:
```
wget https://github.com/hsbasu/simple-pwgen/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd simple-pwgen-master
```

1. **Option 1:** Manually copying necessary files to root (`/`). For that, follow the steps below:
	1. [**Optional**] To make translations/locales in languages other than **English**, run:
		```
		make
		```
		from the `simple-pwgen-master` in a terminal. It will create the translations/locales in `usr/share/locale`.
	
	2. Install python package using `pip3`:
		```
		sudo pip3 install .
		```
		It will install all files under `/usr/local/`
	3. Compile `schemas` using:
		```
		sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/local/share/glib-2.0/schemas
		```

2. **Option 2:** Build a debian package and install it. To build a debian package on your own:
	1. from the `simple-pwgen-master` run:
		```
		dpkg-buildpackage --no-sign
		```
		This will create a `simple-pwgen_*.deb` and `python3-simple-pwgen_*.deb` package at `../simple-pwgen-master`.
	
	2. Install the debian package using
		```
		sudo dpkg -i ../*simple-pwgen_*.deb
		sudo apt install -f
		```
After it is installed, run `simple-pwgen` from terminal or use the `simple-pwgen.desktop`.
